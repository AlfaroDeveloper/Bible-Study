                                The first phrase in the Hebrew text of 1:1 is bereshith ("in [the] beginning"), which is
                                also the Hebrew title of the book (books in ancient times customarily were named after
                                their first word or two). The English title, Genesis, is Greek in origin and comes from
                                the word geneseos, which appears in the pre-Christian Greek translation (Septuagint) of
                                2:4; 5:1. Depending on its context, the word can mean "birth," "genealogy," or "history
                                of origin." In both its Hebrew and Greek forms, then, the traditional title of Genesis
                                appropriately describes its contents, since it is primarily a book of beginnings.

                                "Exodus" is a Latin word derived from Greek Exodos, the name given to the book by those
                                who translated it into Greek. The word means "exit," "departure" (see Lk 9:31; Heb
                                11:22). The name was retained by the Latin Vulgate, by the Jewish author Philo (a
                                contemporary of Christ) and by the Syriac version. In Hebrew the book is named after its
                                first two words, we'elleh shemoth ("These are the names of"). The same phrase occurs in
                                Ge 46:8, where it likewise introduces a list of the names of those Israelites "who went
                                to Egypt with Jacob" (1:1). Thus Exodus was not intended to exist separately, but was
                                thought of as a <span id="dots"></span><span id="more" class="moretext">continuation of

                                    known
                                    as the Pentateuch (see Introduction to Genesis: Author and Date of Writing).

                                Leviticus receives its name from the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation of
                                the OT) and means "relating to the Levites." Its Hebrew title, wayyiqra', is the first
                                word in the Hebrew text of the book and means "And he [i.e., the Lord] called." Although
                                Leviticus does not deal only with the special duties of the Levites, it is so named
                                because it concerns mainly the service of worship at the tabernacle, which was conducted
                                by the priests who were the sons of Aaron, assisted by many from the rest of the tribe
                                of Levi. Exodus gave the directions for building the tabernacle, and now Leviticus

                                    were given, at least for the most part, during the year that Israel camped at Mount
                                    Sinai, when God directed Moses in organizing Israel's worship, government and
                                    military
                                    forces. The book of Numbers continues the history with preparations for moving on
                                    from
                                    Sinai to Canaan.

                                Numbers presents an account of the 38-year period of Israel's wandering in the desert
                                following the establishment of the covenant of Sinai (compare 1:1 with Dt 1:1).

                                simply, debarim ("words"; see 1:1). The word "Deuteronomy" (meaning "repetition of the
                                law") arose from a mistranslation in the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation
                                of the OT) and the Latin Vulgate of a phrase in Dt 17:18, which in Hebrew means "copy of
                                this law." The error is not serious, however, since Deuteronomy is, in a certain sense,
                                a "repetition of the law" (see Structure and Outline).
